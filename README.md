# SkogAI Project
SkogAI is a modular and AI-driven project to manage an Arch Linux workstation. It leverages small, specialized AI agents to handle system tasks, improve workflows, and streamline workstation management. The system prioritizes modularity, environment-variable-driven configurations, and a .d-style structure for dynamic settings. Core functionalities include managing documentation, dotfiles, and system configurations, with the ultimate goal of creating a cohesive and adaptable AI-managed workstation.
