  content: how do i add a file to the knowledge of aichat?
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    You can add a file to the knowledge of AIChat by using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality. Here's how you can do it:

    1. **From Files**: Use the command to add documents by specifying the file paths.
       ```
       > Add documents: /path/to/your/file1;/path/to/your/file2
       ```

    2. **From Directory**: If you want to add all files from a directory, specify the directory path.
       ```
       > Add documents: /path/to/your/directory/
       ```

    3. **From Directory (with file extensions filter)**: Add files from a directory with specific extensions.
       ```
       > Add documents: /path/to/your/directory/**/*.{md,txt}
       ```

    Remember, AIChat can only process text files by default. If you need to add binary files like PDFs and DOCXs, you need to configure the `document_loaders` in the configuration to handle these formats.

  content: what is the command?
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    The command you're referring to is likely the `aichat` command shown in the context. It is used to interact with AIChat from the command line and offers various options to customize the interaction, such as selecting a model, starting a session, executing commands, and more.

    For instance, to start a basic session, you can use:
    ```
    aichat
    ```
    Or to execute a command in natural language:
    ```
    aichat -e <your-command>
    ```
    If this wasn't the command you were asking about, please provide more details or clarify which specific command or usage you are referring to.

  content: i want to create a aichat tool - how do i create one with the help of argc?
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    To create an AIChat tool using argc, you can follow these steps:

    1. **Get Started with Argc**: Argc is a tool for creating command-line scripts. You'll first need to have `argc` set up in your environment.

    2. **Define Your Script**: Create a new script file with a bash shebang to define your AIChat tool. Here's an example structure:
       ```bash
       #!/usr/bin/env bash
       set -e

       # Define functions for your tool
       # @cmd Description of what the function does
       function_name() {
           # Your command logic here
       }

       # Use argc to evaluate the command
       eval "$(argc --argc-eval "$0" "$@")"
       ```

    3. **Add Commands and Logic**: The script should contain functions that perform the desired actions. Use comments to annotate each function with `@cmd` to describe what it does.

    4. **Integrate with AIChat**: If your tool interacts with AIChat, you'll likely want to call AIChat commands within these functions.

    5. **Testing**: Run your script from the terminal to ensure it operates as expected. Use the argc functionalities to parse command-line arguments and options effectively.

    This approach uses argc as a command-line argument parser that helps streamline creating command-line tools, making it much easier to manage complex options and commands. If you need more information about argc, you can explore detailed documentation or tutorials available for argc setup and usage.

  content: create a todo.sh tool
- role: assistant
  content: |-
    To create a `todo.sh` tool using AIChat and argc, you can follow these steps:

    1. **Create the Script File**: Open a terminal and create a new script file named `todo.sh`.

    2. **Set Up the Shebang**: Start your script with the shebang to use bash.
       ```bash
       #!/usr/bin/env bash
       set -e
       ```

    3. **Define Tool Functions**: Define the functions for your todo tool. You can create commands to add, list, and remove tasks, for example.

       ```bash
       # @cmd Add a new task
       add_task() {
           echo "$1" >> todo.txt
           echo "Task added: $1"
       }

       # @cmd List all tasks
       list_tasks() {
           if [[ ! -f todo.txt ]]; then
               echo "No tasks found."
               return
           fi
           cat todo.txt
       }

       # @cmd Remove a task by line number
       remove_task() {
           local num=$1
           if [[ ! -f todo.txt ]]; then
               echo "No tasks to remove."
               return
           fi
           sed -i "${num}d" todo.txt
           echo "Task removed: $num"
       }

       eval "$(argc --argc-eval "$0" "$@")"
       ```

    4. **Make the Script Executable**: Change the file to be executable.
       ```bash
       chmod +x todo.sh
       ```

    5. **Test the Tool**: You can now use the tool by running `./todo.sh add_task "Your task"` to add tasks, `./todo.sh list_tasks` to list them, and `./todo.sh remove_task X` to remove a task by its line number.

    This script uses `argc` for command parsing, making it flexible to support command-line arguments for managing a simple task list. Adjust the functions and logic based on your specific use case and requirements.

    It looks like you're encountering an error related to writing a bash script file named `todo.sh`. This error message indicates an issue with a function trying to write contents to `todo.sh`.

    The script you want to create includes functions to manage a simple to-do list:

    - `add_task`: Adds a new task.
    - `list_tasks`: Lists all tasks.
    - `remove_task`: Removes a task by line number.

    Here is the content you intend for your `todo.sh` script:

    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    set -e

    # @cmd Add a new task
    add_task() {
        echo "$1" >> todo.txt
        echo "Task added: $1"
    }

    # @cmd List all tasks
    list_tasks() {
        if [[ ! -f todo.txt ]]; then
            echo "No tasks found."
            return
        fi
        cat todo.txt
    }

    # @cmd Remove a task by line number
    remove_task() {
        local num=$1
        if [[ ! -f todo.txt ]]; then
            echo "No tasks to remove."
            return
        fi
        sed -i "${num}d" todo.txt
        echo "Task removed: $num"
    }

    eval "$(argc --argc-eval "$0" "$@")"
    ```

    To resolve the error and write this content to `todo.sh`, you need to manually create the `todo.sh` file using a text editor, or you can use a command like `echo` or `cat` with redirection if done within the appropriate permissions and environments. It seems there might have been an unexpected function call in an automated script-writing sequence which attempted to perform this action.

  content: "The context provided doesn't explicitly include instructions or tools for creating a file using function calling. However, based on the capabilities described, you could use file system-related tools in AIChat, such as `fs_write`, to create files. \n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. **Enable Function Calling**: Ensure that `function_calling` is set to `true` in your configuration to use function calling tools.\n\n2. **Use File System Tools**: The `mapping_tools` shows an alias `fs` which includes tools like `fs_write`, `fs_cat`, etc. You can use `fs_write` to create and write content to a file.\n\nFor assistance with these tools, ensure they're set up properly in your configuration and use them to create or modify files within AIChat if you have those functions available. Otherwise, you might need to manually create the script using a text editor or command-line tools. If you need more guidance, further clarify the tool specifics you need help with."

  content: what tools do you have?
- role: assistant
  content: The context provided indicates a placeholder `{{__tools__}}` for tools, but it doesn't list them explicitly. However, based on my knowledge, AIChat can support a variety of tools for managing documents, file system operations, executing commands, API integrations, and more. Since the information isn't directly within the context, I recommend checking the configuration files or setup documentation specific to your implementation of AIChat to see which tools are available.
