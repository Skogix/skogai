ip?

The context does not provide any information about IP addresses. However, if you are asking for your own IP address details, I can retrieve that information for you. Would you like me to do that?

# CHAT: what is my? [2024-12-07T17:08:46+01:00]
what is my?
--------
The context appears to be an excerpt from a GitHub repository's documentation about building tools and agents with LLM functions, and it doesn't directly provide an answer to the question "what is my?" Without additional context or clarification on what "my" refers to in your question, I can't provide a specific answer. Could you please provide more details or clarify your question?
