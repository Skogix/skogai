The code you've provided is a basic command-line todo manager in Python. It allows users to add, view, complete, and delete todo items, with optional attributes like due date and priority. However, some features are not implemented, such as persistence and advanced error handling. If you'd like to enhance it with persistence or additional features, I can guide you with the necessary code changes or suggest improvements.

If you want to create or manipulate your todo items using my system here, feel free to let me know what operations you'd like me to perform!
