echo __TEST__

It looks like you are trying to print the text `__TEST__` to the console using the `echo` command. If you are using a Unix-like shell (such as bash), the command you provided will work correctly and will output:

```
__TEST__
```

If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with the command, feel free to ask!
